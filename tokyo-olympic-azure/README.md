In this project, I will use some ETL and analysis tools in the Microsoft Azure cloud. I will use the Tokyo Olympics public dataset [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo) to create a relational database for analysis.

* Data Factory: A cloud data orchestration service from Microsoft that allows us to create, schedule and automate data transformation and movement workflows. Here is used for ingesting the raw files. It will then send these raw files to a staging area in a data lake.
* Data Lake Gen 2: A scalable and secure storage system from Microsoft that allows you to flexibly and efficiently store and analyze large volumes of data in the cloud.
* Databricks: a data analytics and machine learning platform that offers streamlined collaboration and scalability for processing and analyzing large volumes of data in the cloud. Here is ised for data cleaning and some exploratory data analysis. 
* Synapse: A data analytics platform that integrates large-scale storage and processing to enable advanced analytics and real-time insights.
